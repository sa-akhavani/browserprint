\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Web browsers have become indispensable in our daily lives. The
majority of the online activity of many Internet users comprises of
using a browser to access social media, online shopping, surfing the
web, messaging, and accessing stored information in the cloud.
Unfortunately, as browsers have become critical and important
infrastructure components in our lives, they have also become
attractive targets for attackers who are looking into compromising
them. At the same time, many companies are interested in collecting
the private browser activities of end-users for marketing and sales
purposes. To achieve their data collection objectives, some web
services use ``browser fingerprinting'' to track and profile their
users. Clearly, browser fingerprinting can be in stark contrast with
the web privacy of browser users.

As browsers are becoming increasingly entwined and integrated into
operating systems, many unique details of a user's browser such as its
hardware, operating system, browser configuration and preferences can be
exposed through the browser. An attacker who collects and sums these
outputs can create a unique ``fingerprint'' for tracking and
identification purposes. In addition, browsers have also been
increasing in complexity as more and more new features are being
integrated into them, raising concerns that the attack surface offered
by this software ``bloating'' (i.e., the increase in the number of
components and code not needed by every user) is contributing to
making browsers more difficult to secure against attacks.

Browser fingerprinting has been determined to be an important problem
by previous research (e.g.,~\cite{cookiemonster-SP13,panopticlick,mowery2012pixel,fpdetective}) as well as browser vendors
themselves (e.g.,~\cite{safari-privacy, brave-fpbudget, firefox-fingerprinting}). To date, however, no studies have looked
at popular browsers historically and have attempted to determine how
their fingerprintability has evolved over the years. Analogously, we
are also not aware of studies that have looked into how, and if, the
increase in the number of new features integrated into the browsers
every year have contributed to an increase in the number of reported
vulnerabilities.

In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of a large number of
browser features that have been integrated or phased out of the
popular Mozilla Firefox and the Google Chrome browsers between the
years 2016 and 2020. Our aim is to answer a number of research
questions about the fingerprintability and security of these browsers
over this time period. By analyzing 33 Google Chrome and 31 Mozilla
Firefox major browser versions, our results suggest that these popular
browsers have unique feature sets that make them significantly
different from each other. Hence, by comparing these features to the
fingerprinting APIs presented in literature, we conclude that all of
these browser versions are uniquely fingerprintable. Our results suggest
the alarming trend that browsers are becoming more fingerprintable
over time as newer versions of popular browsers have more
fingerprintable APIs embedded in them. Another key finding of our
study is that unlike the popular folk wisdom that software bloating
always leads to more security vulnerabilities~\cite{Bloating}, the
number of vulnerabilities in browsers are not directly correlated to the
number of new features being supported by those browsers. In fact, our
measurements suggest that browsers are becoming more secure over time
even though they are supporting more features and are becoming more
``bloated''.

This paper makes the following key contributions:

\begin{itemize}

\item We show that all major Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browser
  versions between 2016 until today are uniquely fingerprintable.

\item We analyze both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome and report
  major differences between feature introduction and removal
  trends. While Firefox tends to keep a steady number of features in
  the browser (i.e., introducing new features while removing older
  ones), Chrome, in contrast, is growing and more features are kept as
  the browser evolves.

\item As Firefox and Chrome are becoming more ``bloated'' over time
  and as their sizes increase, there is no direct correlation between
  the total number of features in the browsers and the number of
  vulnerabilities that are reported.

\item We provide all the datasets that we have collected in our
  experiments to the community at [redacted for submission].
  
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next section lists
the research questions we aimed to answer in this study. Section
\ref{sec:methodology} describes our methodology and data gathering
techniques. Section \ref{sec:analysis} presents a different analysis
based on the feature reports and their relation to browser
vulnerability. In Section \ref{sec:related-work}, we present the
related work and then briefly conclude the paper in Section
\ref{sec:conclusion}.
